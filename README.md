# REFINED
This repository is made temporarily to share the REFINED (Representation of Features as Images with NEighborhood Dependencies). Therefore the code is not provided as an easy-to-use package. To use the REFINED to create images corresponding to your dataset you neet to use the following codes step by step. REFINED contains two main cores, initial MDS and hill climbing, where both are eucliadean distance based. First the initiall coordinates will be created by MDS initializer part, then the coordinates will be updated by the hill climbing. Multiple functions are being used in the process, hence a Toolpox.py is provided which includes all the function needed.
